(AP) — Perhaps luckily for Miami students, Hurricanes coach Manny Diaz is not in charge of how the university’s academic side hands out grades. Transcripts would look very different if he ran that part of the school. With a promise that his players will spend the next four weeks competing every day for their on-field jobs, Diaz’s first training camp as Miami’s coach opened Friday night. The Miami native was hired Dec. 30, hours after Mark Richt retired — a move that opened the door for his defensive coordinator, who had already taken over as Temple’s head coach, to spurn the Owls and return to the Hurricanes. “I’m not against the grading system, but if you really want to win, there’s two grades — there’s an A-plus and there’s an F,” Diaz said. “You’re either all the way right, or all the way wrong. … And we are going to strive to be all the way right in everything we do.” It was a first practice unlike any other for Miami: A 7 p.m. start on a Friday night, done so the school could invite 1,000 fans to grab free tickets and come see the normally closed proceedings. The open practice was announced Wednesday; tickets were gone within a few hours and school officials were took plenty of calls from fans who missed out on the tickets and were desperate for any other way to watch. Most had to leave after about 45 minutes, once lightning started popping up a few miles from campus. Diaz likes to say this is ‘The New Miami.’ So far, that’s very much the case — with some nods to the old Miami thrown in as well, such as a renewed commitment to 1-on-1 competition from the weight room to the practice field. “Just his energy, his vibe, his vision for the program, what he wanted to do, ‘The New Miami,’ bringing some of that old-school Miami back, putting us back where we need to be,” wide receiver K.J. Osborn, who transferred to Miami from Buffalo, said when asked what Diaz’s appeal was during the transfer process. “A great guy from Miami. Easy to speak to. Tremendous person. Tremendous coach, father. Really, really a great guy.” There are some major issues for Miami to clear before the Hurricanes head to Orlando, Florida for the Aug. 24 opener against the rival Florida Gators — a very early opener on national television, a week before most teams start playing, designed to kick off a season-long celebration of what’s being recognized as the 150th year of college football. For starters, there’s no starting quarterback. N’Kosi Perry split the starting role with now-graduated Malik Rosier last year, Tate Martell transferred in from Ohio State and Jarren Williams redshirted last year while drawing rave reviews from those who saw what he was able to do in practices. Diaz hasn’t said when he’ll decide on a starter. And he isn’t dropping any hints on when he’ll announce the winner of that competition, either. “You’ll find out when you find out,” Diaz said. There’s an offensive line and a secondary to rebuild, some questions about who will be the starting running back, who will emerge as the go-to receiver. The strength of the team will likely be the linebacker corps, led by senior Shaquille Quarterman. He’s played under Diaz for three years, and said that the attitude he brought to the defense as a coordinator is already getting through to the rest of the roster. “I think that is very, very dangerous because that guy, he has put the feeling of winning into everybody he coaches, everybody he talks to, everybody he mentors,” Quarterman said. “It’s just a breath of fresh air. At the same time he always talks about two things: you’re defined by your toughness and your word. If you play the way with the mentality that he preaches, we’re going to be fine.” That was one of the things Diaz hoped people would see at the rare open practice. There were no state secrets offered — no schemes for Florida are going in yet, no real clues on who will start and who won’t were coming from the first practice. But there was a clear sense of what Diaz will want to see when it comes to being all the way right, that difference between getting an A-plus or an F on a given play. “If you go watch all 128 teams practice over the next three weeks, everyone is running the same drills, everyone is doing the same thing,” Diaz said. “It’s the level of accountability and the attention to detail and learning how to do it … that’s what sets people apart.”","summary":"CORAL GABLES, Fla.

(AP) — Even though Dan Mullen has enjoyed plenty of success as a head coach at Mississippi State and Florida, he’s never won more than 10 games in a season. He seems poised for a breakthrough. He certainly has a team capable of making it happen. Mullen opened his second season with the Gators on Friday amid the program’s highest expectations in nearly a decade. Florida made a six-win jump in Mullen’s inaugural campaign and believes a number of returning starters and coaching continuity will help maintain the upward trend. “We have some guys that can look at last season and have the maturity to look and say, ‘Hey, we had 10 wins, but we missed some opportunities,'” Mullen said. “We could have been even better. … There also were some games that we let get awful close that it could very easily have been an eight-win season, seven-win season. “When you really understand that and understand how small the margin for error is, that’s how you get those wins. That’s why it is so difficult.” Much of Florida’s turnaround in 2018 could be traced to the 4-7 debacle the previous year. The offense was downright inept in 2017, the defense faded down the stretch and coach Jim McElwain was gone before November. Mullen harnessed all his players’ frustration for motivation, and it worked. Now, the Gators are expected to open the season with their highest ranking in the AP poll since 2010. Maintaining it could be more difficult in Year 2, especially with what appears to be a more daunting schedule. The Gators open against Miami on Aug. 24 in Orlando. They also face Georgia in Jacksonville, Auburn on homecoming and have road games against Kentucky, LSU, South Carolina and Missouri. Miami and Florida last played in 2013, with the Hurricanes winning for the seventh time in the last eight meetings. “We’re ready and anxious to get this season started for that game,” quarterback Feleipe Franks said. Franks is a main reason for Florida’s optimism. He was one of the country’s most improved passers in 2018, capable of burning defenses with his arm and legs. The 6-foot-6 sophomore accounted for 31 touchdowns — 24 passing and seven rushing — and just six interceptions. Now a junior, Franks has a better grasp of Mullen’s offense and his role in getting the ball to play-makers Van Jefferson, Trevon Grimes, Kadarius Toney, Tyrie Cleveland, Freddie Swain and Josh Hammond. It’s the deepest and most experienced group of receivers Florida has had in years, probably since the program’s last national title in 2008. “Now that we’re familiar with the offense, we’re going to be a lot better,” Jefferson said. The biggest unknown is the offensive line, which has several new starters. They will be tested against Miami, which typically has one of the best defensive fronts in the Atlantic Coast Conference. “If you’re not treating it like it’s the biggest game you’ve ever played in in your life, then you’re doing the wrong thing,” said center Nick Buchanan, who started 12 games as a junior. “It doesn’t matter when we’re playing, who’s we’re playing or where we’re playing, put the ball down and we’ll be ready.” Mullen and the Gators were relieved when defensive coordinator Todd Grantham shunned a job offer from the NFL’s Cincinnati Bengals and stayed in Gainesville. Grantham should have his best group in three seasons, a unit that features arguably the best cornerback tandem — C.J. Henderson and Marco Wilson — in the Southeastern Conference. The Gators also boast plenty of talent up front, led by Adam Shuler, Jabari Zuniga and former Louisville defensive end Jon Greenard. It remains to be seen whether Mullen and his players have closed the gap on SEC front-runners Alabama and Georgia. But they could have enough to get Mullen more than 10 wins for the first time as a head coach. “I hope the familiarity helps a lot, that we’re able to get things done faster, quicker, smoother and progress at a much quicker rate because they know what to expect and know what’s about to come. It limits question marks,” Mullen said. “But I certainly hope we still play with a chip on our shoulder.”","summary":"GAINESVILLE, Fla.

(AP) — Marcus Lattimore looks like he could still take the football 10 yards from the goal line, break three tackles and finish in the end zone as he often did in his record-setting career at South Carolina. Instead, Lattimore’s task these days comes away from the field in helping the Gamecocks handle the stresses of major college football and prepare for life when the games are done. Few know better than Lattimore, 27, how things can change for a can’t-miss player tagged for the NFL. “It’s a part of who I am,” Lattimore says with a smile. Lattimore starts his second year as South Carolina’s director of player development for life skills and head of the team’s Beyond Football program. He looks tapered and strong, certainly strong enough to start in the backfield for any host of pro teams who coveted him during his college days. Lattimore rushed for 1,197 yards — third best in the Southeastern Conference — as a freshman in 2010, guiding the Gamecocks to their only SEC Eastern Division title. But Lattimore’s production was cut short in his final two seasons after devastating knee ligament injuries curtailed his career. The second one, at home against Tennessee in October 2012, essentially ended Lattimore’s football days although he was drafted by San Francisco the following spring and tried to rehab at the NFL level. He spent nearly two seasons on the non-football injury list and gave up the game in November 2014. “You knew Marcus wasn’t going to let that keep him down,” Steve Spurrier, Lattimore’s college coach, said. Lattimore, a South Carolina native, returned to campus and finished his degree in public health. Spurrier’s fulltime successor Will Muschamp knew there had to be a role for a charismatic, smart, respected ex-star like Lattimore, whose name is on Williams-Brice Stadium for his record 38 career rushing touchdowns. Lattimore was hired in January 2018. “He’s walked where they’ve walked,” Muschamp said. “I can talk about it, but he’s lived it.” Lattimore loves the game, but doesn’t miss the contact and the day-after soreness. He misses the locker room camaraderie and being alongside people enduring the same things as him. Lattimore tries to bring that to the Gamecocks, along with the perspective high school dreams of NFL glory don’t always work out. “When you look at them, you empathize with what they go through and you see a reflection of yourself,” Lattimore said. “In the same mindset of, ‘If I don’t make it to the NFL, then what?’ Everything was in one basket. I have the opportunity to kind of shift that mindset a little bit.” South Carolina’s Jay Ulrich has met with Lattimore several times the past year as he adjusted to switching from quarterback to wide receiver. “He’s been where we’re at and now he’s just trying to serve and help us,” Ulrich said. “Not only just get through college, but thrive both on the field and off the field.” Muschamp gives Lattimore the flexibility to speak to youth groups, camps and functions. Lattimore partners with Select Health of South Carolina with the focus on teaching children the importance of good health. Lattimore attends three or four outings a month throughout the state, young fans swarming for a picture or autograph just like his days as the state’s best high school runner with a bright, athletic future. Lattimore is thrilled about his new path. “It’s not only fulfilling, it has revealed my purpose,” Lattimore said. Lattimore hopes to return to school for a degree in organizational psychology where he can concentrate on helping groups and individuals build a healthy culture to have success in any field. It’s something Lattimore has understood well since his days in college and the knee injuries that changed his course. “I feel like that’s how my life has been. You’ve got to overcome some type of fear,” he said. “I overcame my fear and it ended up working out.”","summary":"COLUMBIA, S.C.

(AP) — Clemson officials are confident the athletic department’s practices and policies will prevent a repeat of the failed performance-enhancing drug tests that caused three players to be suspended before last season’s College Football Playoff. The Tigers were riding into a fourth straight CFP appearance when they were hit with the news in December that star defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence, reserve offensive lineman Zach Giella and freshman tight end Braden Galloway had tested positive for the banned substance ostarine. Lawrence missed both his team’s semifinal and championship wins on the way to their second national title in three years. In the seven months since the ban, Clemson has double and triple checked how it handles everything from talc in the weight room to the protein shakes it provides to ensure the wrong things won’t cost players time on the field. “We’ve always looked at a really robust and fundamentally sound drug-testing program,” Clemson athletic director Dan Radakovich said. “We’ve always looked at how we get our supplements into our students’ hands.” The department’s review came through the NCAA appeal led by Lawrence, Giella and Galloway, who were subject to a one-year ban for the positive tests. The NCAA rejected the players’ appeal this past spring. All three have said they had no idea how ostarine got into their systems. Coach Dabo Swinney has said the Tigers have a track record of doing things clean. Clemson’s athletic department said it had administered 329 test for performance-enhancing drugs since 2014 and all had come back clean except for those of Lawrence, Giella and Galloway last December. Any supplement used is first reviewed by Clemson sports medicine and nutrition departments along with its NCAA compliance office before getting approved for us by athletes. Clemson athletic spokesman Jeff Kallin said the Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act prevents the school from discussing the appeal. Kallin said the athletes asked Clemson not to comment about what went into its NCAA appeal. Lawrence, an all-Atlantic Coast Conference lineman, g ave up his final season to turn pro and was drafted 17th overall by the New York Giants. Giella was a graduate who had used three of his four years of eligibility so he is no longer part of the program. The lone loss this season is Galloway, a promising, 6-foot-4 sophomore who figured to compete for a starting spot this fall. Galloway will practice this season and could return in time for a late December bowl game, Swinney said. NCAA rules say a player is suspended for a calendar year after a positive test. The three were tested after the Clemson’s win in the ACC title game in early December. “If we’re fortunate enough to be in a high level postseason game that’s after the middle of December” Galloway would be eligible, Swinney said. “If we’re playing early in December we probably didn’t have a very good year. But he would have the opportunity, I think, to be back for that.” Tight ends coach Danny Pearman said Galloway, who caught a TD pass in his first college game last September, was devastated after losing the appeal. Pearman let the disappointed Galloway vent a bit about the issue when they talked, then challenged him to stay engaged with the team knowing he had two more seasons of college football ahead. “Sometimes it isn’t fair, but how do you deal with it? Do you cry over spilled milk or ‘Woe is me?'” Pearman said. “That hasn’t been his style at all. He’s not necessarily embraced (missing the year), but he’s learning to deal with it every day and making the best of it.” The Tigers list fourth-year junior J.C. Chalk as the starting tight end heading into summer training camp. Chalk had four catches for 40 yards in his career. Radakovich sees last year’s failed tests as a rare breakdown and not a signal that the department’s process needed an overhaul. “This was such an outlier, I don’t know” if there were any lessons the school could take out of it that weren’t already in place, he said.","summary":"CLEMSON, S.C.

With 17 starters returning, the Utes believe the ultimate breakthrough could be coming soon. So do the voters in the annual preseason poll of media members released Wednesday prior to the conference’s media day in Hollywood. Utah was tabbed as the preseason favorite to win the Pac-12 for the first time since joining the conference in 2011, receiving 12 of 35 votes in the sharply divided ballot. Oregon received 11 votes and defending champion Washington had 10. “We definitely need to get back to that game and want to get back to that game so that we can come out victorious on that night,” Utah running back Zack Moss said of the Pac-12 title game that the Utes lost to the Huskies last season. Utah was an even stronger favorite to become the Pac-12’s first repeat South Division winner, though UCLA did appear in the first two conference title games when Southern California was ineligible to participate in 2012 because of NCAA sanctions. The Utes received 33 votes to win the South, with the other two going to the Trojans. Whittingham credits improvement in the passing game for getting the program to its currently lofty heights. Always known for strong play on the offensive and defensive lines, it wasn’t until senior quarterback Tyler Huntley and his receivers brought more consistency and explosiveness to the offense that Utah finally won the South. Despite losing Huntley and Moss for part of the season because of injuries, Utah still averaged 30 points per game even after failing to score a touchdown in that 10-3 loss to Washington in the title game. The Utes then blew a huge early lead over Northwestern and lost the Holiday Bowl to finish 9-5, yet still won at least nine games for the fourth time in the past five seasons. “We’re still not a finished product,” Whittingham said. “I don’t know anybody that is. But we feel like we’re certainly better equipped right now than at any time that we’ve been in the league to be competitive.” But Utah’s status as a Rose Bowl favorite might be as much a reflection of the instability elsewhere in the conference as it is the Utes’ solidity. The perennially talented Trojans, who were picked to finish second in the South Division and received two first-place votes in the Pac-12 race, are coming off a 5-7 season with coach Clay Helton under pressure to produce an immediate turnaround. Arizona State, UCLA and Arizona each carry flashes of promise in their second seasons under new head coaches, while Colorado starts over with former Georgia defensive coordinator Mel Tucker at the helm. The Pac-12 North is more muddled. One point separates Oregon from Washington as the favorites, followed by Stanford and Washington State. Oregon brings back senior quarterback and top NFL prospect Justin Herbert behind an experienced offensive line, but has a new defensive coordinator in former Boise State assistant Andy Avalos. Washington has won two of the past three conference titles, but must replace four-year starting quarterback Jake Browning. Stanford, which hosts Washington and Oregon this season, won the North Division in 2013, 2015 and 2017 when welcoming both teams to the Bay Area. But the Cardinal lost their two most important offensive playmakers from last season in running back Bryce Love and receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside. Washington State received one first-place vote in the North Division and the Pac-12 race after winning 11 games last season, but needs a new quarterback after the departure of graduate transfer quarterback Gardner Minshew, last season’s breakout star. Even lightly regarded California with its dominant defense and Oregon State with its surprisingly explosive offense can make things difficult for teams with title aspirations. “I think it’s as deep as we have ever been,” Stanford coach David Shaw said. “I think we’re deeper than any other conference. I don’t think any other conference can rattle off more than half the conference as legitimate contenders.” For Utah, that unpredictability increases the urgency to make sure any and all issues are addressed before what could be a historic season. “Prepare each and every week as if we’re not so talented, we’re not No. 1 in people’s eyes and things like that,” Moss said.","summary":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Utah had been in the Pac-12 for eight years before coach Kyle Whittingham’s team finally won its first division title and played for the conference championship last season.

That has led Commissioner Larry Scott to possibly try a new scheduling approach this season. Instead of “Pac-12 After Dark”, welcome to “Breakfast with the Pac-12”. Scott said Fox and conference athletic directors are in preliminary talks about morning kickoffs for some games, which would put them in the network’s key noon Eastern time slot. Any morning kickoffs, which would be at 9 a.m. Pacific and 10 a.m. Mountain, would be voluntary and not dictated by Fox. “That would be new and somewhat out of the box, but I’ve tried to put everything on the table,” Scott said. “I think there are some schools and markets that might respond positively.” Coaches are split about the possibility of a morning kickoff. Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said the sooner they can start, the better. “We’d adjust. We’ve played those games before. It’s been few and far between, but we’ve had those 10 a.m. kickoffs in the past. We’d jump at the chance for that,” he said. Stanford’s David Shaw said he would be somewhat resistant. “All the studies we’ve all read and conducted ourselves on our campus, our sleep studies, it is better for young people to perform athletically if they get a full night’s sleep,” Shaw said. “And I don’t know that you can find any group of 18- to 22-year-old young people that are going to go to bed at 10 o’clock at night to get up at 6 o’clock in the morning to make sure they can perform athletically.” SOMETHING TO PROVE Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert remembers watching as a boy as Jeremiah Masoli, Darron Thomas and Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota led the Ducks to conference titles. After deciding to return to school instead of declaring for the NFL draft, Herbert hopes to join that fraternity of quarterbacks as a senior. Herbert threw for 3,151 yards and 29 touchdowns as a junior last season but Oregon still finished fourth in the Pac-12 North. “We’ve been through the highest of highs and lowest of lows and we’ve seen all the success that’s been at Oregon so we’re capable of looking at it and realizing this isn’t where we wanted to be,” Herbert said. “There’s a direction that we’re heading and I think we need to keep going that way.” Oregon was a narrow pick to win the Pac-12 North in the annual media poll released Wednesday after finishing one point ahead of rival Washington. The Ducks also received 11 votes to win the Pac-12 title game. Herbert was pleased to receive the nod. However, he recognizes it means nothing if Oregon can’t back it up on the field. PRESEASON TEAM Utah placed five on the preseason all-conference team. Four of the players are on defense — linemen Bradlee Anae and Leki Fotu along with defensive backs Julian Blackmon and Jaylon Johnson. Running back Zack Moss was the lone pick on offense. Colorado wide receiver Laviska Shenault Jr was the only player to be listed on all 33 ballots. Oregon and Stanford had four players apiece. Ducks quarterback Justin Hebert was first team on all but two ballots and Cardinal defensive back Paulson Adebo was listed on 32 of 33. LEACH THE TEACH If Washington State coach Mike Leach found the latest offensive innovation during his foray into academia this past spring, he doesn’t seem to be tipping his hand. Leach taught a five-part seminar called “Leadership Lessons in Insurgent Warfare and Football Strategies,” and students had to design plays as part of the final project. Having overseen an offense that has averaged at least 320 yards passing per game in each of his first seven seasons with the Cougars, Leach was certainly qualified to grade their work. Whether any of those plays will be added to the playbook of Leach’s “Air Raid” spread offense is another matter. Offensive lineman Liam Ryan did not notice anything out of the ordinary during spring practice in March and April. However, given Leach’s penchant for surprise, Ryan won’t rule out seeing one of those plays show up in the fall.” “We did not practice anything different in spring ball so I have no idea what goes on in his mind,” Ryan said. “He’ll pull out something, I know that for sure.” NEW BOWL The Pac-12 will be adding the Los Angeles Bowl to its postseason lineup when it begins in 2020. The Los Angeles Bowl will feature a matchup between teams from the Pac-12 and Mountain West in the NFL stadium under construction. The Pac-12’s commitment to the game runs through 2025. “We are thrilled to partner with the Los Angeles Bowl and bring a Pac-12 presence to the new state-of-the-art facility at LA Stadium, in one of the biggest markets right in our footprint,” Scott said. ____ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25","summary":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Pac-12 has heard plenty of criticism from fans and coaches about a third of games being played at night last year.
